## 📝 Execution History Logs
### Task 1 Completion Log (2026-06-08)
- Bootstrapped Next.js 16 environment with TypeScript & Tailwind CSS, updating `package.json` to enable Turbopack (`next dev --turbo`).
- Restructured layouts/routing beneath localized sub-paths under `src/app/[lang]/` (`layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`).
- Created custom `src/proxy.ts` edge interceptor to redirect/rewrite missing paths using Accept-Language and cookie parsing.
- Verified a clean build state and zero ESLint errors/warnings.
- Next sequential task: **Task 2: Tailwind Theme Configuration**.

### Task 2 Completion Log (2026-06-08)
- Created `tailwind.config.ts` mapping the luxury brand design tokens and explicit typography scale with line heights.
- Modified `src/app/globals.css` using Tailwind CSS v4 `@theme` directive to inject color classes and define global dark-first resets.
- Refactored `layout.tsx` and homepage `page.tsx` to utilize premium classes like `bg-brand-obsidian` and `text-brand-platinum`.
- Verified compilation and layout rendering with a zero-error ESLint/lint validation suite execution pass.
- Next sequential task: **Task 3: Translation System**.

### Task 3 Completion Log (2026-06-08)
- Created static dictionaries for English, French, Swahili, and Kirundi in `src/dictionaries/` using an identical key-value structure aligned with premium EV features and strictly respecting the 0 Km rule.
- Implemented a type-safe dynamic dictionary loader in `src/lib/get-dictionary.ts`.
- Integrated the loader in `src/app/[lang]/page.tsx` to dynamically fetch and display translations.
- Verified a clean build state and zero linting warnings/errors by executing both build and ESLint test suites.
- Next sequential task: **Task 4: Database Migration: Supabase vehicles Table**.

### Task 4 Completion Log (2026-06-08)
- Created `supabase/migrations/20260608000000_create_showroom_schema.sql` with the `vehicles` and `vehicle_images` tables using pure PostgreSQL, enforcing strict CHECK constraints (`price_usd > 0`, `stock_count >= 0`, status restricted to `available | reserved | allocated`) and zero references to mileage, odometer, or used-car concepts.
- Added Row Level Security on both tables: open public `SELECT` policies for unauthenticated catalog reads; `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` locked to `authenticated` role administrators only.
- Created a `CREATE INDEX` on `vehicle_images.vehicle_id` to maximize join performance over Bujumbura 3G/4G network profiles.
- Authored `src/types/database.types.ts` with full TypeScript interfaces (`Vehicle`, `VehicleImage`, `VehicleWithImages`, `VehicleStatus`) and the Supabase `Database` generic shape including `Row`, `Insert`, and `Update` helpers for both tables.
- Verified a clean, zero-error lint pass via `npm run lint` (ESLint returned no warnings or errors).
- Next sequential task: **Task 5: Database Migration: Supabase `charging_stations` Table (GIS Geolocation Bounds)**.

### Task 5 Completion Log (2026-06-08)
- Activated PostGIS extension and created `public.charging_stations` table with `GEOGRAPHY(POINT, 4326)` coordinates column, `total_plugs`, `power_output_kw`, `status`, and `access_type` fields guarded by strict CHECK constraints.
- Created GIST spatial index `charging_stations_geo_idx` on the `coordinates` column for index-backed bounding-box queries over Bujumbura 3G/4G network profiles.
- Authored the `charging_stations_in_bounds(min_lat, min_long, max_lat, max_long)` RPC function using the PostGIS `&&` bounding-box intersect operator, callable directly from the Next.js client via `supabase.rpc()`.
- Applied Row Level Security: open public `SELECT` policy for unauthenticated map layers; `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` locked to the `authenticated` role.
- Extended `src/types/database.types.ts` with `GeoJsonPoint`, `ChargingStation`, `ChargingStationWithDistance`, `ChargingStationsInBoundsArgs` interfaces and wired them into the `Database` generic shape; lint passed with zero warnings.
- Next sequential task: **Task 6: Strict Runtime Schema Mapping: Form Input & Payload Validation via Zod**.

### Task 6 Completion Log (2026-06-08)
- Installed `zod` v4 (`^4.4.3`) as a project dependency.
- Created `src/lib/validations/showroom.ts` with two Zod schemas: `vehicleInputSchema` (13 fields covering brand text, powertrain numbers, commercial metrics, and `status` enum) and `chargingStationInputSchema` (8 fields covering meta text, flat lat/lng coordinates, infrastructure specs, and two enums).
- **Retry fix:** Migrated all schemas from Zod v3 API to Zod v4 API — replaced deprecated `required_error` / `invalid_type_error` params with unified `error` param, and replaced `{ message: '...' }` with `{ error: '...' }` in `.min()`, `.max()`, `.positive()`, `.int()` validators.
- All error messages use i18n translation key paths (e.g. `validation.vehicle.brand_required`) for zero-hardcoded-string policy, enabling future locale overrides without touching schema logic.
- Exported `VehicleInput` and `ChargingStationInput` compile-time types via `z.infer<>` — structurally aligned with interfaces in `src/types/database.types.ts`.
- Verified zero TypeScript errors (`tsc --noEmit`) and zero ESLint errors/warnings (`npm run lint`).
- Next sequential task: **Task 7: Atomic Media Asset Optimization: Performance-Gated Cloudinary CDN Image Wrapper**.

### Task 7 Completion Log (2026-06-12)
- Created `src/lib/utils/cloudinary.ts` with `getOptimizedCloudinaryUrl` injecting `f_auto,q_auto:eco` and width constraints for performance on local Burundi networks.
- Built atomic `src/components/ui/PremiumImage.tsx` utilizing Next.js `Image` and a custom loader, enforcing a luxury obsidian fallback skeleton.
- Implemented strict metadata sanitization within `PremiumImage` to fallback to generic luxury text and prevent any leakage of "0 Km" rule violations.
- Verified zero errors and warnings passing through the `npm run lint` quality gate.
- Next sequential task: **Task 8: Multi-Lingual Layout Navigation Header Matrix**.

### Task 8 Completion Log (2026-06-12)
- Verified modular layout navigation component `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` which handles dynamic localization segments for `en`, `fr`, `sw`, and `rn`.
- Configured premium theme layout colors including `brand-obsidian` (#070807) and `brand-espresso` (#1F1C18) borders.
- Verified interactive mobile responsive design overlays and instant locale routing exchanges without resetting user parameters.
- Validated compile and lint pipeline states with zero errors.
- Next sequential task: **Task 9: Corporate Compliance Global Footer Layout**.

### Task 9 Completion Log (2026-06-12)
- Extended all four locale dictionaries (`en.json`, `fr.json`, `rn.json`, `sw.json`) with a full `footer` key block covering `tagline`, `columns` (corporate, diplomatic, sustainability, legal), `trust`, `badges`, `newsletter`, `social`, and `bottom` — fully translated for each language, zero references to any 0 Km-forbidden terminology.
- Created `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` as a flat `'use client'` functional component with five visual zones matching the screenshot reference: top trust pillars strip, main 4-column nav grid with brand identity + newsletter sidebar, a warranty badges strip, and a localized bottom bar with back-to-top button.
- Wired `Footer` into `src/app/[lang]/layout.tsx` alongside an explicit `<main>` semantic wrapper for children; the `Dictionary` type in `get-dictionary.ts` automatically infers the new `footer` shape via `typeof enDictionary`.
- All design tokens (Obsidian Canvas `#070807`, Espresso Trim borders, Champagne Gold hover states, Skyline Crimson active states) applied per Agent.md spec; only Lucide-React icons used in compliance with approved dependency list.
- Lint gate passed with zero errors/warnings via `npm run lint`.
- Next sequential task: **Task 10: Homepage Hero Section: High-Fidelity Asset Viewport**.

### Task 10 Completion Log (2026-06-12)
- Created `src/components/home/HeroBanner.tsx` — a pixel-perfect React Server Component implementing a full-bleed cinematic hero with 3 stacked z-index layers: the `Hero_BG_with_car.png` background image, a left-side gradient shroud for text legibility, and a bottom blend gradient merging into the brand-partners strip.
- Implemented dual CTAs: primary Skyline Crimson filled pill (`Explore Showroom`) and secondary Champagne Gold outlined pill (`Charging Infrastructure`), wired to i18n dictionary keys `hero.ctaPrimary` / `hero.ctaSecondary` for all four locales.
- Built the "Our Electric Brand Partners" strip below the hero, surfacing BYD, MG, and Toyota with local logo assets (`BYD_LOGO.png`, `MG_LOGO.png`, `TOYOTA_LOGO.png`) in espresso-bordered cards with gold hover states.
- Upgraded `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` to match the reference: transparent-to-opaque scroll behavior, Skyline logo image, five nav items (Home / Inventory / Services / About Us / Contact), and a gold-outlined "Book a Test Drive" pill CTA.
- Lint quality gate passed with zero errors/warnings via `npm run lint`. Next sequential task: **Task 11: Parametric Filter Dropdown Selector Matrix**.

### Task 11 Completion Log (2026-06-19)
- Built `src/components/showroom/InventorySearch.tsx` containing the Parametric Filter Dropdown Selector Matrix (Brand, Body Type, Range) matching the provided layout.
- Styled with strict `Aureate Obsidian` mapped design tokens (`brand-obsidian`, `brand-espresso`, `brand-gold`).
- Verified zero errors through `npm run lint`.
- Next sequential task: **Task 14: Zero-Wear Structural Vehicle Card Layout**.

### Task 14 Completion Log (2026-06-19)
- Created `src/components/showroom/InventoryVehicleCard.tsx` embodying the zero-wear structural vehicle card layout.
- Integrated cinematic wide vehicle frames with absolute premium badges and specification data points without mileage or used-car terminology.
- Built explicit 'View Details' and 'Book Test Drive' call-to-actions using `brand-gold`.
- Verified zero ESLint errors via `npm run lint`.
- Next sequential task: **Task 15: Responsive Inventory Stream Grid with Dynamic Query Filters**.

### Task 15 Completion Log (2026-06-19)
- Generated `src/app/[lang]/showroom/page.tsx` (Inventory Showroom) assembling the filter matrix and vehicle cards into a responsive stream grid.
- Hydrated components with factory-fresh inventory mock data strictly observing the 0-Km rule.
- Verified zero structural errors with ESLint via `npm run lint`.
